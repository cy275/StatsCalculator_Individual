Standardized Score:

Standardized values (also called standard scores or normal deviates) are the same thing as z-scores. A standardized value is what you get when you take a data point and scale it by population data. It tells us how far from the mean we are in terms of standard deviations.

Standardized score = Z = (X - μ) / σ
