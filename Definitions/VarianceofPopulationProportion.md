Variance of population proportion:

tells us how data points in a certain population are spread out. It is the average of the distances from each data point in that certain population to the mean, squared.

Population proportion example: There are 1000 people, and 250 are blue-eyed. The proportion would be 250/1000 = 25% Variance of population proportion is based on this 25%

Variance of population proportion = Ïƒp**2 = PQ/N

Where P is the proportion of population elements that have a particular attribute.
Q = 1 - P, is the proportion of population elements that do not have a particular attribute.
N is the number of elements in a population
