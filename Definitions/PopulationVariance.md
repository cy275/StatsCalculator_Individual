Population Variance:

Population variance is a measure of the spread of population data. Hence, population variance can be defined as the average of the distances from each data point in a particular population to the mean, squared and it indicates how data points are spread out in the population. Population variance is an important measure of dispersion used in statistics. Statisticians calculate variance to determine how individual numbers in a data set relate to each other.

Population variance = σ**2 = Σ ( Xi - μ )**2 / N
