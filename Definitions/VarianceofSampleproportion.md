**Variance of Sample proportion:**

Sample variance is defined by the following formula, and uses a slightly different notation:

s2 = Î£ ( xi - x )2 / ( n - 1 )

where s2 is the sample variance, x is the sample mean, xi is the ith element from the sample, and n is the number of elements in the sample.

Observations from a simple random sample can be used to estimate the variance of a population. 

Using this formula, the sample variance can be considered an unbiased estimate of the true population variance. 

Therefore, if you need to estimate an unknown population variance, based on data from a simple random sample, this is the formula to use.

Variance of sample proportion = sp2 = pq / (n - 1)
