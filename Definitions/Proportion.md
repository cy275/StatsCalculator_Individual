**Proportion:**

A proportion is a special case of the mean. 

It represents the number of observations that have a particular attribute divided by the total number of observations in the group. 

Use this formula to estimate the population proportion:

Sample proportion	  = p =  	Observations with attribute/Total sample size (n)


**Example:** There are 1200 students in a class and 1,056 of them own a cell phone.

Proportion = p = 1,056/ 1200 = 88%

Hence, 88% of all students in the class own cell phone.
