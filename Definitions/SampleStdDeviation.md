**Sample standard deviation:**

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. 

Thus, the standard deviation of a sample is:

s = sqrt [ s2 ] = sqrt [ Î£ ( xi - x )2 / ( n - 1 ) ]

where s is the sample standard deviation, x is the sample mean, xi is the ith element from the sample, and n is the number of elements in the sample.
