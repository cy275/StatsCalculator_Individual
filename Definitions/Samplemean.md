**Sample Mean:**

The mean of a sample is computed by adding all of the observations in the sample and dividing by the number of observations. 

In the general case, the mean can be calculated, using the following equations: 

Sample mean = x̅ = Σx / n 

Σx is the sum of all the sample observations, and n is the number of sample observations.
